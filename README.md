Double Dare is a fun two-player quiz battle game where players answer questions to gain points and stay alive. Answer correctly to earn points and keep playing, but wrong answers cost you health! The player with the highest points or who survives wins.

2. Enter Player 1 and Player 2 names.
3. Choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
4. Players take turns answering quiz questions.
5. Correct answers earn points (+5) and allow you to keep playing.
